## Features

- **No Vendor Lock-In:** Jotx liberates your notes from vendor lock-in. Your notes are stored in a Git-compatible format, giving you the freedom to push them to remote Git repositories like GitHub. Your notes, your control.

- **Automatic Git-Based Sync:** Jotx leverages Git to automatically synchronize your notes across all your devices. No manual syncing is required, minimizing version conflicts and ensuring your notes are up-to-date.

- **Offline Note-Taking:** Work on your notes offline, ensuring your ideas are captured regardless of your internet connection status. Your notes are always available at your fingertips.

- **Advanced Conflict Resolution:** Collaboration is made simple with Jotx. Whether you're collaborating with others or working from different devices offline, jotx uses Git's robust conflict resolution mechanisms. It seamlessly merges changes and, in cases where the same lines are modified, offers alternative variants for user-driven resolution.
